## About

This is a simple app i'm writing with a simple goal to sharpen my frontend and go skill aswell as keep my adhd in check

As this project isn't even close to completion, no realeses are going to availible for the forseable future

If you want to contribiute or use the beta versions you will need to install the [wails](https://wails.io) cli and install dependencies via ```go get``` and ```npm install```
